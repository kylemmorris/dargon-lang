# The Dargon Programming Language

<img src="res/img/dard_the_dragon.png" alt="dard" width="200"/>

Dargon is a small passion project and toy language with a focus on being:

- Fun
- Artistic and "always experimental"
- Free and open-source (FOSS)

Dargon is currently not aiming to be:

- The next general-purpose programming language
- Built for speed or critical applications

**Dargon is still largely in the design phase.**
