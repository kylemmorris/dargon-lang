## The Dargon Programming Language

**This is still a work in progress!**

Dargon is a toy language with the sole purpose of *extending the boundaries of programming language design*. To start things off, let’s be clear on what it is, and what it is not:

What it is:
- Fun and artistic
- Free and open-source
- “Always experimental” guaranteed

What it is not:
- The “next general-purpose programming language”
- Chocked-full of user-created libraries
- Built for speed, or memory-critical applications
- A fully-featured environment

The full Dargon experience aims to deliver the following:
- A portable interpreter/REPL.
- Syntax highlighting for popular text editors (Vim, GEdit, etc.)
- Full, local documentation that is always available.

See "doc/Dargon Language Specification" for the full documentation.

## Current Roadmap

Dargon is a learning experience for me as an artistic project.
As a result, this roadmap is subject to change. I'll try to make use of GitHub's project

- Initial Language Specification.
- Lexical Analysis.
- LL(1) Parser.
- ...
- Example files created (Hello World, Fibbonacci, and 99 Bottels of Beer). 
- Entry created on RosettaCode (https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code).
- Version 0.1.
