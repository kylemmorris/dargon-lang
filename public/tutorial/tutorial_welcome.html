        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
            This tutorial assumes no programming experience, and attempts
            to explain advanced computer science concepts in simple terms. 
            Some familiarity with programming certainly helps, but is not required.

        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p>
            To start coding, all you need is the Dargon command-line interface (CLI) and
            a text editor. The CLI is the all-in-one tool for programming in
            Dargon (it's an interpreter, compiler, and library builder - neat!).
            If you're not familiar with what a <i>command line</i>
            is, see this <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/"> nifty guide.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Running DIR in the command line (./dargon) without any inputs
            will begin the Dargon Interpreter (DIR). Here, DIR will await your
            input in what is more commonly referred to as
            a "Read-Eval-Print-Loop" (REPL):
        </p>
        <p class="dargon console">
            ~/home/demo$ ./dargon<br/>

            Welcome to the Dargon Interpreter (DIR)! For help, type 'help', to exit type 'quit'.<br/>

        <h2>Hello Dargon!</h2>
        <p>
            Let's jump right in starting with an established tradition with
            our own little twist. Start by creating a new text file called 
            "Hello.dargon":
            <div class="dargon">
                <span class="predef">print</span>(<span class="string">"Hello Dargon!"</span>)
            </div>
            <footer class="figure">Hello.dargon</footer>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dargon Interpreter (DIR) comes with a set of pre-defined <b>functions</b>,
            one of which is "print". This function takes a string and outputs 
            it to the console. Let's use Dargon to execute this file:
        </p>
        <p class="dargon console">
            ~/home/demo$ ./dargon Hello.dargon<br/>
            Hello Dargon!<br/>
            ~/home/demo$
        </p>
        <p>
            Great! But this is not all that Dargon is capable of. 
            Before we go too much further, let's go over Dargon's syntax more
            thoroughly.
        </p>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>
            A "comment" refers to a piece of code that is set to 
            be intentionally ignored, which is useful for 
            documenting your code for yourself and others. 
            In Dargon, there are 3 kinds of comments. Lines that 
            start with the pound ("#") character are <b>line comments</b>, 
            in which the entire line is ignored. If a pair of parenthesis 
            surround two pounds, it creates a <b>block comment</b> that can 
            extend as many lines as you want, given the end is also marked.<br/>

            The final type of comment is the <b>To-Do</b> comment. Like any other
            comment, DIR ignores it. However, when prompted, DIR can analyze 
            all todo comments and provide a report to the programmer listing 
            all of the things that still need to be done. This is useful when
            a To-Do list of your project is requested.
            See below for some examples:
        </p>
        <p class="dargon">
            <span class="comment"># This is a line comment, and thus ignored by DIR</span><br/>
            Dargon code...<br/><br/>
            <span class="comment">(#<br/>
             This is a block comment and<br/>
             extends multiple lines.<br/>
             Wow!<br/>
            #)<br/>
            </span>
            Dargon code...<br/><br/>
            <span class="todo-comment">#! This is a todo comment, and will be reported by DIR!</span><br/>
            Dargon code...<br/><br/>
            <span class="todo-comment">(#!<br/>
            Finally this is a todo block comment!<br/>
            Notice how the matching end does not contain an excalamation mark.<br/>
            #)<br/>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Declarations</h2>
        <p>
            In programming languages, a <b>declaration</b> is a statement 
            which declares a constant, variable, function, or some other 
            programming construct. Dargon allows you to declare <b>variables</b>, 
            meaning that it's value can change throughout the code, or 
            <b>constants</b>, meaning that its value cannot change once initialized.
            Create a new file named "Declare.dargon" and plug in the following 
            lines:
        </p>
        <div class="dargon">
            <span class="kw">fixed real</span> PI = <span class="numeric">3.1415926</span><br/>
            <span class="kw">int</span> errorCode = <span class="numeric">0</span><br/>
            <span class="kw">bool</span> flag <span class="comment"># Given the default value 'false'</span><br/>
            print(<span class="string">"Pi up to 7 digits is equivalent to: {PI}"</span>)<br/>
        </div>
        <footer class="figure">Declare.dargon</footer>
        <p>
            This file so far declares two things: a constant (fixed)
            <b>real</b> number named "PI", and a variable <b>integer</b> named
            "errorCode". It also assigns each one a value. It then prints the 
            contents of "PI" to the screen by <i>inserting</i> its value into the 
            string via the curly brace syntax (described later). Run this via DIR:
        </p>
        <p class="dargon console">
            ~/home/demo$ ./dargon Declare.dargon<br/>
            Pi up to 7 digits is equivalent to: 3.1415926<br/>
            ~/home/demo$
        </p>
        <p>
            Dargon is <i>statically-typed</i>, meaning the <i>type</i>
            of each variable must be given on declaration (Dargon does not
            "guess" what the type is). In this case, the types are <b>real</b>
            and <b>int</b> respectively.<br/>

            When something is declared, 
            if it is not given a value, it uses its <i>default</i> value. 
            For integers and reals, this is 0 and 0.0 respectively, for booleans 
            this is false, and for strings this is the empty string (""). 
            Everything always has a value in Dargon - no nulls are allowed
            (unless it's of a <b>nullable</b> type - more on that later).<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>In Dargon, the rule of thumb is: if you, the programmer, 
                cannot deduce the type of a declaration, then Dargon cannot 
                and will not allow it.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dargon also allows multiple declarations per line. You can
            get away with not declaring types <i>if</i> the same type
            applies to each variable. See this example:
        </p>
        <div class="dargon">
            <span class="comment"># Notice how each one is separated with a comma ','</span><br/>
            <span class="kw">fixed int</span> one, two, three = <span class="numeric">1, 2, 3</span><br/>
            <span class="kw">string</span> myName, <span class="kw">int</span> myAge = <span class="string">"Veronica"</span>, <span class="numeric">34</span>
        </div>
        <footer class="figure">Declare.dargon</footer>
        <p>
            You may have noticed that Dargon uses the newline character (enter key) as its
            statement delimiter (like ';' in a <a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/role-of-semicolon-in-various-programming-languages/">lot of programming languages</a>). If you
            want a statement, such as a declaration, to extend multiple
            lines, you must add the tilde "~" character at the end of your line
            like so:
        </p>
        <div class="dargon">
            <span class="kw">fixed int</span> one, two, three = <span class="kw">~</span><br/>
            <span class="numeric tab">1,</span> <span class="kw">~</span><br/>
            <span class="numeric tab">2,</span> <span class="kw">~</span><br/>
            <span class="numeric tab">3</span><br/>
        </div>
