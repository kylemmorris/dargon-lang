        Dargon is a lightweight programming language
        aimed at being fun and intuitive. It tries to balance
        pushing the boundaries of language design while also being desirable 
        and enjoyable to use. It adds a lot of cool features and syntactic sugar,
        but it's also cozy and familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Being a passion project, Dargon is still in its <b>very</b> 
        early stages, and is not ready for public usage. That being said, a tutorial 
        that doubles as a requirements document, can be found 
        <a href="public/tutorial/tutorial_welcome.html">here</a> for the determined.
        This is a live document and is ever changing.
