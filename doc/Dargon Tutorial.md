# Dargon Tutorial - v0.1

Dargon is a lightweight, simple interpreted programming language aimed at being fun and intuitive. It tries to balance the thin line of pushing the boundaries of language design while also being desirable and enjoyable to use. It adds a lot of cool features and syntactic sugar, but it's also cozy and familiar. 

## Hello Dargon!

Let's jump right in starting with an established tradition with our own little twist:

*File: Hello.dargon*

```
print("Hello Dargon!");
```

The Dargon Interpreter (DIR) comes with a set of pre-defined *functions*, one of which being "print". This function takes as input a string and outputs it to the console. Let's use DIR to see this in action:

```
~/home/demo$ ./dargon run Hello.dargon
Hello Dargon!

~/home/demo$ 
```

## Environment

All you need to start coding in Dargon is a text editor and the Dargon Interpreter (DIR). Simply pass DIR a script file with the *.dargon extension and it will run it with the 'run' command. Using the 'go' command like so will begin Dargon's interactive mode, more commonly referred to as a "Read-Eval-Print-Loop" (REPL):

```
~/home/demo$ ./dargon go
DIR>
```

Here, DIR will await your input and then run that input. This is great for testing out things, or just messing with the language. More to come on this section.

## Declarations

In programming languages, a "declaration" is a **TODO**.
